# To-Do App
This is a simple web-based To-Do application built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to:

- Add new tasks via an input form.
- Display tasks in a scrollable list without expanding the layout.
- Remove individual tasks using a delete button.
- Automatically update and display the number of completed tasks in the header.

No libraries or frameworks are used — ideal for beginners who want to understand how DOM manipulation and event handling works.
